# Overview

Every day, the Intelligence and Security Division (ISD) faces a massive influx of unstructured data. Intellexis tackles this challenge by transforming chaotic data into actionable intelligence. Our product processes raw text, extracts key entities, relationships, and events, assigns risk scores, and visualizes data connections using network graphs—all in real-time.

Key Features:

- BIA Dashboard: Offers structured intelligence from unstructured news data.
- Custom Dashboard: Upload custom datasets for personalized, deep analysis.
- Sentiment Analysis: Visualizes the emotional tone of global narratives.
- Risk Scoring: Calculates risk scores for countries, entities, and events based on their interactions with Singapore.
- Network Graphs: Interactive visualizations to explore relationships between people, organizations, and events.
- AI-Generated Insights: Contextual, real-world insights based on AI algorithms and case studies.
- CSV Upload Feature: Allows you to analyze your own datasets on-demand.

# Features

- Structured Data: Convert raw, unstructured text into structured data using advanced NLP techniques (e.g., SpaCy, Azure’s OpenAI API).
- Risk Scoring: Evaluate the level of threat posed by entities based on frequency, sentiment, and other factors.
- Customizable Dashboards: Tailor your analysis with personalized dashboards and CSV upload functionality.
- Interactive Network Graphs: Visualize relationships between key entities using dynamic graphs.
- Real-Time Insights: Get up-to-date analysis with scalable, real-time data processing.
- Multilingual Support: Future support for multiple languages.

# How It Works

Intellexis operates in five major stages:

1. Data Cleaning: Raw unstructured data is cleaned and preprocessed to make it usable.
2. Entity & Relationship Extraction: Key entities (countries, organizations, individuals) and relationships are extracted from the data.
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Statistical analysis to uncover patterns and trends.
4. Risk Scoring: Risk scores are assigned to entities based on their interactions and the emotional tone of their narratives.
5. Network Graph Visualization: Relationships and data connections are visualized in interactive network graphs for deeper analysis.

# Demo

You can see Intellexis in action through two core dashboards:

- BIA Dashboard: View unstructured news data structured using NLP. Visualize sentiment distributions, discover hidden relationships, and pinpoint top sources of information.
- Custom Dashboard: Upload your own CSV files to generate real-time insights tailored to your needs.

Demo Highlights:

- Sentiment Distribution: View emotional tones (positive, negative, neutral) of global news narratives.
- Correlation Matrix: Identify relationships within data.
- Entity-Relationship Network Graphs: Visualize connections between key entities like countries, organizations, and individuals.
- AI-Generated Insights: Risk scores and actionable intelligence tailored to Singapore's security landscape.
