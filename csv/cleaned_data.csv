Betta fish originated from Thailand but can be found in nearby countries such as Malaysia, Indonesia, Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia. Wild bettas live in shallow, freshwater areas such as rice paddies, stagnant ponds, marshes, and slow-moving streams. Being used to Asian climates, they prefer warm water around 80º Fahrenheit. Colder water can cause them to become lethargic, stop eating, or become more prone to disease or infection. Their diet mainly consists of plankton, crustaceans, and larvae.

Because their usual habitats are extremely low in oxygen, bettas have evolved to breathe air at the water’s surface. This ability develops over time: hatchlings rely on their gills, but adults gulp air and capture the oxygen from it using something called a labyrinth organ, which is attached to the gills and functions similarly to a human lung.",habitat betta fish originated from thailand but can be found in nearby countries such as malaysia indonesia vietnam laos and cambodia wild bettas live in shallow freshwater areas such as rice paddies stagnant ponds marshes and slowmoving streams being used to asian climates they prefer warm water around 80º fahrenheit colder water can cause them to become lethargic stop eating or become more prone to disease or infection their diet mainly consists of plankton crustaceans and larvae because their usual habitats are extremely low in oxygen bettas have evolved to breathe air at the waters surface this ability develops over time hatchlings rely on their gills but adults gulp air and capture the oxygen from it using something called a labyrinth organ which is attached to the gills and functions similarly to a human lung,"{'ORG': ['the british museum', 'the british museum'], 'GPE': ['chile'], 'CARDINAL': ['two', 'one'], 'DATE': ['1868'], 'QUANTITY': ['some 2300 miles'], 'LOC': ['pacific coast']}",Positive,0.2444444444444444,0.0666666666666666

They were discovered on China’s Chengdu Plain, at an archeological dig site called Sanxingdui (which translates as “three star mound”).

Thought to be the largest and oldest site left by the Shu kingdom, a civilization in southwestern China once only hinted at in myths and legends, Sanxingdui was not discovered until the 1920s, when a farmer stumbled across objects while digging an irrigation ditch. The site has since been found to contain the ruins of an ancient city made up of residences, sacrificial pits and tombs enclosed by high dirt walls.

As the olivine dissolves in seawater, a chemical reaction occurs that pulls CO2 from the air and eventually locks it up in the ocean in dissolved bicarbonate form.

It is one of a number of techniques known as enhanced rock weathering that start-ups are testing on land and at sea.

Vesta has tested its technology on a beach in New York’s Hamptons, spreading olivine on the coast and mixing it with sand.
